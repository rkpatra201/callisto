/**
 * The recursion tree sees sometimes a leaf node is becoming intermediate node.
 * so it is not a use case for memo approach.
 * <p>
 * **Memoization is not suitable for this problem when using DFS with backtracking.
 * ** Hereâ€™s why:
 * <p>
 * ### ðŸš« **Why Memoization Wonâ€™t Work Well Here**
 * Memoization works best when:
 * - **Overlapping subproblems exist** (i.e., the same recursive calls return the same results).
 * - **Results can be reused** without affecting correctness.
 * <p>
 * However, in **DFS with backtracking for finding all paths**, memoization doesnâ€™t help because:
 * 1. **Paths are dynamic**: The path being explored depends on previous choices. Storing a previously computed result can lead to incorrect paths in new branches.
 * 2. **Each call depends on different state**: The state (visited nodes, path structure) differs between calls, so memoized results might not be valid.
 * 3. **No true overlapping subproblems**: Even if we reach the same word multiple times, the set of paths leading to it may differ. Storing a single best path for a word can discard valid paths.
 * <p>
 * ### âœ… **When Memoization Can Help**
 * Memoization **does** work in **shortest path problems** (like BFS-based solutions), where:
 * - You track the shortest path from a node to the target.
 * - Paths do not change dynamically during recursion.
 * <p>
 * ### **Conclusion**
 * - **For finding all paths â†’ No Memoization (DFS + Backtracking is enough)**
 * - **For shortest path only â†’ Memoization works in BFS but not in DFS**
 * - **For all shortest paths â†’ Use BFS first, then DFS**
 * <p>
 * Would you like to explore an optimized BFS-based approach for shortest paths? ðŸš€
