Kubernetes (k8s) is a container orchestration platform that provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. Below is a detailed overview of its architecture and the responsibilities of its key components.

### **Kubernetes Architecture**

#### 1. **Control Plane**
The control plane manages the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring the desired state of applications and resources. Its key components include:

- **API Server**
    - Acts as the front end of the Kubernetes control plane.
    - Exposes the Kubernetes API to interact with the cluster.
    - Handles RESTful API requests and updates the state of the cluster in the etcd datastore.
    - Responsible for authentication, validation, and authorization.

- **etcd**
    - A consistent and highly available key-value store.
    - Stores all cluster data, including configuration and state.
    - Acts as the source of truth for Kubernetes.

- **Scheduler**
    - Assigns workloads (Pods) to Nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and constraints.
    - Considers factors like resource availability, affinity/anti-affinity rules, and taints/tolerations.

- **Controller Manager**
    - Runs various controllers to ensure the cluster matches the desired state.
    - Key controllers:
        - **Node Controller**: Tracks and responds to node availability.
        - **ReplicaSet Controller**: Ensures the specified number of pod replicas run.
        - **Endpoints Controller**: Maintains the association between services and pods.
        - **Job Controller**: Manages job objects to ensure pods complete tasks.

- **Cloud Controller Manager** (optional)
    - Integrates with cloud provider APIs for tasks like load balancing, node provisioning, and storage management.

#### 2. **Node Components**
Nodes are the machines (virtual or physical) where containers run. Each node contains:

- **Kubelet**
    - An agent running on each node.
    - Ensures containers described in PodSpecs are running and healthy.
    - Communicates with the API server.

- **Container Runtime**
    - Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O).
    - Interfaces with the kubelet via the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).

- **Kube-proxy**
    - Implements networking rules for communication between pods, services, and external clients.
    - Manages IP tables or IPVS to handle service discovery and routing.

- **cAdvisor** (integrated into kubelet)
    - Collects resource usage data (CPU, memory, filesystem, etc.) from containers for monitoring.

#### 3. **Persistent Storage**
- Kubernetes uses persistent storage solutions to retain data even when pods are terminated.
- Storage is abstracted through Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

---

#### 4. **Cluster Networking**
Kubernetes enforces the following networking model:
- Pods can communicate with all other pods without NAT.
- Nodes can communicate with all pods and vice versa.
- Implements network policies to secure communication.

### **Responsibilities**

#### **Control Plane Responsibilities**
- Maintain the desired state of applications and workloads.
- Monitor and respond to cluster health and state changes.
- Assign workloads to nodes effectively using the Scheduler.
- Provide APIs for management and scaling of applications.

#### **Node Responsibilities**
- Run workloads (containers) as defined in PodSpecs.
- Ensure container health and report the status to the control plane.
- Handle networking and routing within the cluster.

#### **Networking Responsibilities**
- Facilitate seamless communication between pods, services, and external systems.
- Enforce network security rules via network policies.

#### **Storage Responsibilities**
- Provide persistent storage for applications using PVs and PVCs.
- Allow dynamic or static provisioning of storage resources.

By distributing responsibilities across these components, Kubernetes provides a robust and scalable platform for managing containerized applications.
